# Swift Macro Examples

Macros have landed in [Swift 5.9](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.9-released/#macros). As they
are no longer experimental, these examples have been migrated to
[swift-syntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/tree/main/Examples), where they tested as part
of the continuous integration of Swift.
